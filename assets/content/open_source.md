# Open Source

I believe shared knowledge makes stronger systems. I contribute where I can and always design with maintainability in mind.

- Internal forks of open-source frameworks (Whisper, YOLO)
- Docker GPU stack improvements for AI workflows
- OpenTrace-based contributions during CovidTrace project

Future contributions will focus on:
- Human-centered AI tooling
- Quiet creative tools that help people think and build

Helping the ecosystem grow is part of the work.
