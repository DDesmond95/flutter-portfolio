I write about Applied AI, calm software, and how technology can respect human life.

These aren’t just technical notes. They are reflections on how to build better systems and better days.

## Topics I write about
- Human-centered AI
- Prototyping with clarity
- Speech & language systems
- Low-stress product design
- Thoughtful DevOps automation

I share things that I know are useful, and that I want to remember.
