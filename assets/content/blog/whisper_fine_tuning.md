# Lessons from Fine-Tuning Whisper for Real-World Speech

I worked on **multiple Whisper-based prototypes** for the justice sector (Malay + English).:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

Speech in real life is messy:
- Courtrooms
- Multiple accents
- Legal jargon
- Interruptions

## What I learned

### 1) Context is king
The same sentence changes meaning with tone, speaker role, and timing.

### 2) Good data > good models
Cleaning and labeling matter more than architecture.

### 3) Users forgive errors if trust is earned
Clear transcripts + tools to correct mistakes calmly.

### 4) Automation is about workload, not perfection
“Save my team 3 hours a day” > “100% accuracy”

Whisper is great. Whisper **with** humans in mind is even better.
