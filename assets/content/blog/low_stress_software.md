# Low-Stress Software: The Next Competitive Advantage

Most software adds noise.

More alerts. More buttons. More expectations.  
Less peace.

I believe good tech should:
- **Support focus**
- **Have fewer steps**
- **Be quiet until needed**
- **Respect privacy and time**

## Calm is not slow

I work calmly, but I deliver on time:
> “Plan well, work calmly; no rush without reason.”:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

Calm systems scale. Chaos does not.

Good tools help us breathe easier.
