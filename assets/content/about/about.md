# About Me

I work in Applied AI. I build systems that are simple, useful, and made for real human life. AI is not just machines or models. It is how people live with a system every day.:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

I focus on turning complexity into clarity. I build things that save time, reduce noise, and feel calm to use.

## What I believe

- Tech should **help people**, not stress them.:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
- **Simple, fair, strong** is better than quick and flashy.:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
- Good systems feel **safe** and protect privacy.:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
- Work should give people **time and energy** back.:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

## Who I am outside work

I explore psychology, philosophy, and reflective practices to understand why people use tools the way they do. I care about inclusion and space for different needs.:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## A future I’m building toward

I want to create quiet web tools for video, art, creative work, and game-like learning. I use prototyping, dependable automation, and deployment to turn ideas into long-term value.:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

Success for me is **low stress**, **clear work**, and **more free time**.:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
