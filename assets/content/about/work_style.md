# How I Work

- Plan well. Work calmly. No rush without reason.:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}
- Quiet, steady delivery. Long-term focus.:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}
- Async-first collaboration. Clear written communication. Few short meetings.:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}
- Test, learn, adjust. Question assumptions (even my own).:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}
- Privacy and flexibility show respect.:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}

## Human-centered Engineering

I build systems that people **trust** and **use without stress**.:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}  
Tech should reduce noise, not add more of it.

## My personality as a strength

I am analytical (INTP): I break down complex problems into structure and clarity.:contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}  
I value independence and deep focus. I learn fast by exploring and testing ideas myself.

Big Five snapshot:
- High **Openness** → creativity, curiosity  
- Low **Extraversion** → clear thinking in calm, focused environments  
- Moderate Agreeableness → empathetic but with boundaries  
- High Neuroticism → emotional awareness that helps design sensitive tools

I care about meaningful work that lasts.
