# What I Use

## Desk & Hardware
- Quiet ergonomic setup
- Laptop: Linux + Windows dual use
- External GPU when needed for ML tasks

## Coding Style
- Minimal IDE distractions
- Formatters and linters on save
- Write first, optimize later

## Workflow
- Async-first
- Plan small, ship steady
- Systems that reduce noise and give time back

Tools change. Values stay the same.
