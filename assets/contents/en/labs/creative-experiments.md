# Creative Experiments

These are small explorations where code meets art — prototypes that balance structure and emotion.

---

## 🎵 1. Whisper Music Mapper

Convert vocal tone to generative piano notes via pitch analysis.  
Built in Python using librosa + MIDI output.

---

## 🖋️ 2. Haiku Synthesizer

LLM fine-tuned on haiku structures to produce short poetic fragments based on temperature = 0.4.  
Goal: explore linguistic compression.

---

## 🧩 3. Visual Grammar

A Flutter web experiment mapping grammar tokens into color bands.  
Each part-of-speech generates a color frequency pattern — text becomes image.

## 🌗 Reflection

Artistic code reveals emotional logic in systems.  
By mixing computation and creativity, you see where algorithms stop and human intention begins.
