# Calm Technology — Designing for Attention, Not Addiction

We often equate “modern technology” with motion, noise, and constant notification.  
But true progress is quieter: it happens when technology blends into human rhythm.

---

## 🧩 Definition

**Calm technology** is not about minimalism — it’s about _respect for attention_.  
A calm system communicates only when necessary, and gracefully fades when not.

---

## 🧠 Principles

1. **Information should reside in the periphery, not the center.**  
   Good systems make people aware, not anxious.
2. **The right amount of technology is the minimum needed.**  
   Overengineering is just another form of waste.
3. **Calm systems trust human judgment.**  
   They don’t force behavior; they support decision-making.

## 🧰 Application in Engineering

- Limit background notifications; expose metrics quietly.
- Design dashboards that summarize, not shout.
- Build rollbacks that restore calm after failure.

In my projects, “calm” isn’t a design aesthetic — it’s a performance metric.

## 🌱 Reflection

Calmness isn’t the absence of activity. It’s _coherence._  
When systems and humans move in sync, energy flows smoothly.

> “A well-designed system feels less like software and more like space.”

## 🔮 Future Direction

Integrating calm principles into AI evaluation dashboards — alerts that inform, never alarm.
