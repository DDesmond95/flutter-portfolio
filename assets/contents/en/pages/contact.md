# Get in Touch

Thank you for your interest.  
I enjoy working with people who care about clear thinking, ethical technology, and calm systems.

---

## 📬 Primary Contact

**Email:** [`hello@desmondliew.dev`](mailto:hello@desmondliew.dev)  
Plain-text emails are appreciated — no large attachments for first contact, please.

**Short call:** [Schedule a 15-minute intro](https://calendly.com/desmondliew/intro)  
Use this for project fit checks, not deep technical consulting.

## 🎯 Who This Page Is For

### 1. Projects & Consulting

If you’d like help with:

- applied AI systems (LLMs, Whisper, on-prem deployments),
- evaluation pipelines and observability,
- automation architecture and workflow design,

please include:

- a short description of your context,
- your goals and constraints,
- approximate timeline and budget range.

---

### 2. Engineering & Collaboration

For engineers, researchers, and builders who want to:

- discuss evaluation, calm infrastructure, or systems design,
- explore possible collaborations (tools, dashboards, templates),
- co-write or co-present on related topics,

keep your note focused and scoped. I’m happy to exchange ideas, but I can’t provide ongoing free consulting.

---

### 3. Press, Talks & Events

If you’re inviting me to speak or contribute:

- include event name, format, and date,
- topic you’d like me to cover,
- expected audience and technical depth.

You can also refer to the [Media Kit](/library/media-kit) for bio, headshot, and assets.

---

### 4. Students & Learners

If you’re a student or early-career engineer:

- I can’t promise long-term mentorship,
- but I do my best to answer **specific, well-framed questions** when time allows.

Tell me briefly:

- who you are,
- what you’re working on,
- one concrete question or decision you’re stuck on.

---

### 5. Feedback, Bugs & Improvements

If you:

- found a typo,
- noticed a broken link,
- have a suggestion to improve clarity,

thank you — these messages are very welcome.  
Please include the page URL and a short note about what you noticed.
