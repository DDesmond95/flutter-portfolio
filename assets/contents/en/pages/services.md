# Work With Me

I help teams **design, build, and stabilise** AI-driven systems that behave predictably.

---

## 🧠 Core Services

### 1. Applied AI Prototyping

Transform concepts into usable tools.  
I build LLM and ASR prototypes using FastAPI, Docker, and LangChain, with a focus on maintainability and cost control.

### 2. On-Prem Deployment & MLOps

I design CI/CD pipelines, model serving layers, and evaluation frameworks for private infrastructure.  
Includes observability, rollback, and data governance guardrails.

### 3. Automation Audits

Identify where time is lost and how to automate calmly — without breaking human context.

### 4. Technical Writing & Training

I translate complex architectures into clear docs and teach teams to think in systems.
