# 👋 Hi, I’m Desmond Liew

**Applied AI Engineer · System Architect · Builder of Calm Technology**

I design and develop human-centred AI systems that stay stable under pressure.  
My work blends strong engineering discipline with quiet, ethical intent — clarity before cleverness, people before features.

Technology should **reduce noise**, not add to it.  
Good engineering creates space for human focus and trust.
