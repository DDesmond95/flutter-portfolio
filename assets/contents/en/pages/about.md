# About Me

I’m Desmond Liew, an **Applied AI Engineer** focused on building ethical, maintainable, and privacy-first systems.  
I love structured thinking, calm processes, and crafting tools that outlive trends.

## 🧭 Principles That Guide Me

1. **Clarity before cleverness** — clean architecture outlasts shortcuts.
2. **People before features** — a system is successful only when it reduces stress.
3. **Measure what matters** — latency, reliability, human trust.
4. **Transparency over hype** — document, evaluate, improve.

## 🧩 Journey

I started as a curious developer fascinated by how reasoning systems work.  
Through experimentation with speech recognition, LLM ops, and system design, I learned to balance technical rigour with human context.

Today I prototype and deploy AI systems for real-world use — from judicial transcription engines to internal automation platforms.

## 🧠 Work Philosophy

As an INTP and systemic thinker, I thrive on solving logical puzzles and designing frameworks that make sense.  
My goal is not to ship faster, but to ship with understanding — to know _why_ a decision works.

---

## 🌱 Outside Work

When I’m not building software, you’ll find me gardening, reading philosophy, or practising qigong.  
Balance and stillness help me see systems more clearly.
