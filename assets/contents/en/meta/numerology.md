## 🧠 Interpretation

- The **6 vibration** shapes how I interact with others — diplomatic, fair-minded, protective.
- The **7** defines inner orientation — truth, philosophy, constant questioning.
- The **4** manifests externally — building frameworks, maintaining discipline.

The triad forms a clear equation:

> Harmony (6) + Wisdom (7) → Structure (4)

## 🪶 Reflection

Numerology is symbolic logic — ancient data modeling.  
It doesn’t predict; it describes _shape_.  
I treat it as poetry that reminds me to design systems aligned with my natural geometry.

> “My code vibrates at 4; my ethics at 6; my curiosity at 7.”
