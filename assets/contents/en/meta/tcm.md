# Traditional Chinese Medicine — Engineering Through Nature

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) describes the world as interdependent processes —  
a systemic feedback model long before systems theory existed.

## 🧩 Five Element Framework

| Element   | Role in Systems Thinking                |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Wood**  | Growth, expansion, iteration.           |
| **Fire**  | Activation, processing, transformation. |
| **Earth** | Stability, mediation, context.          |
| **Metal** | Precision, logic, pruning.              |
| **Water** | Reflection, adaptability, flow.         |

Balanced systems cycle energy through all five without stagnation.

## 🧠 Engineering Analogy

| TCM Concept        | System Equivalent             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Yin–Yang           | Load vs. Rest cycles          |
| Qi flow            | Data flow & energy efficiency |
| Meridian           | Network topology              |
| Organ interactions | Microservices dependencies    |

## 💡 Lesson for Engineers

- **Overheating (Fire):** burnout → throttle workload.
- **Overcontrol (Metal):** rigidity → allow feedback.
- **Stagnation (Earth):** bureaucracy → simplify.
- **Excess growth (Wood):** scope creep → prune.
- **Weak reflection (Water):** lack of postmortem → schedule retrospectives.
