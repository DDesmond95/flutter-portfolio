# Archetypal Framework — The Tarot as System Metaphor

I study Tarot not as fortune-telling, but as a symbolic system — an ancient operating manual for human cognition and cycles.

## 🧩 Core Archetype: Justice

**Card XI — Justice**  
Represents balance, accountability, and moral clarity.  
It mirrors my engineering ethos: truth through transparency, equilibrium through evidence.

In my life, it manifests as **a demand for structural fairness** — every decision must have symmetry between cost and benefit.

## 🕯️ Supporting Archetype: The High Priestess

**Card II — The High Priestess**  
Symbol of reflection, silence, and deep intuition.  
In systems terms, she represents **latent intelligence** — processes that operate beneath conscious control but maintain stability.

I see her as the counterbalance to Justice:  
Logic defines fairness; intuition defines timing.

## 🧠 Tarot as Model Language

Each card can be seen as a **component in a dynamic system**:

- The Fool: initialization (start of process).
- The Magician: execution (manifestation).
- The Tower: forced transformation (error handling).
- The Star: recovery (renewal).

This metaphor bridges my analytical and intuitive modes.  
Tarot becomes a way to read the architecture of change.

## 🌗 Reflection

Tarot helps me externalize complex internal logic — a form of symbolic debugging.  
It’s not superstition; it’s semiotic system design.
