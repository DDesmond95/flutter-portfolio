# BaZi — Structural Pattern of My Energy (Private)

The BaZi chart (八字) represents the configuration of my internal and external energies at birth.  
I treat it not as superstition, but as a **pattern recognition system** describing innate tendencies and environmental compatibility.

## 🧮 Core Configuration

| Pillar | Element      | Ten God        | Description                                       |
| ------ | ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Year   | Metal Rat    | Resource Star  | Analytical and curious — early pattern formation. |
| Month  | Earth Ox     | Output Star    | Structured, strategic, slow refinement.           |
| Day    | Metal Snake  | Self Element   | Deep focus, sharp reasoning.                      |
| Hour   | Water Rabbit | Influence Star | Intuitive, articulate, flexible communicator.     |

## 🧠 Interpretation

The chart shows **strong metal and earth** — stability, logic, and internal discipline.  
Water introduces reflection and adaptability.  
Wood (growth) appears later in life cycles, symbolizing teaching and dissemination.

Balance theme: **Refinement through reflection.**

## 🪶 Application

- Favor environments with clarity and structure.
- Avoid emotional volatility in work cultures.
- Optimal rhythm: steady, cyclical creation — project > rest > document > share.

## 🔮 Forecast Principles

I don’t predict events — I predict _tendencies_.  
My path always leans toward roles that require:

- analysis over expression,
- systems over spontaneity,
- precision over persuasion.
