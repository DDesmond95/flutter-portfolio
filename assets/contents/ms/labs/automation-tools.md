# Automation Tools

Calm automation means fewer moving parts — small scripts that quietly maintain reliability.

---

## 🔁 1. Markdown Indexer

Scans `/assets/contents` and generates sitemap.json for Flutter route mapping.

---

## 🧱 2. Release Packager

Python script that zips builds for Windows, Linux, and Android into `/releases/`.

---

## 🕯️ 3. Content Encryptor

Encrypts Markdown files with AES when `visibility: "private"` appears in front-matter.

---

## 🕰️ 4. Backup Mirror

Cron-friendly script that mirrors `/assets` to offline drive with version metadata.
