# Ethics in LLM Evaluation — The Human Cost of Measurement

Evaluating language models is not purely a technical task — it’s a moral one.  
Behind every benchmark lies a choice: what do we consider _right_, _fair_, or _safe_?

---

## ⚙️ The Hidden Layer of Evaluation

Every evaluation system embeds assumptions:

- What constitutes “correctness” in text?
- Whose language patterns define fluency?
- Which biases are invisible because they mirror social norms?

---

## ⚖️ Fairness by Design

1. **Transparency:** document test data origins.
2. **Diversity:** include multilingual and cultural variance.
3. **Feedback Loops:** treat human evaluators as collaborators, not cheap labor.

Without these, benchmarks can silently reproduce discrimination.

## 🧠 Human Well-being

Evaluators often face psychological strain reading toxic content.  
Ethical pipelines must:

- Limit exposure duration.
- Provide opt-out and rotation.
- Compensate fairly for emotional labor.

## 💡 Framework Proposal

| Pillar                   | Implementation                                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Consent**              | Workers understand purpose and risk.          |
| **Traceability**         | Every eval data source documented.            |
| **Restorative Auditing** | Mistakes acknowledged and corrected publicly. |

## 🔮 Closing

AI ethics isn’t a policy checkbox — it’s an engineering constraint.  
Fairness and performance must coexist by design, not afterthought.
