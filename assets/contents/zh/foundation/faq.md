# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is this site?

A personal portfolio and knowledge base.  
It documents my projects, philosophy, and experiments in applied AI.

---

## Do you use tracking or analytics?

No.  
This site is built on a privacy-first principle — no tracking cookies, no third-party analytics.

---

## How do I contact you?

Use the [contact page](/contact) or email `hello@desmondliew.dev`.  
I usually respond within one business day.

---

## Can I reuse your code or ideas?

In general, yes — with attribution.  
For any production use or commercial integration, please reach out so we can discuss context.

---

## Why so much focus on “calm systems”?

Because technology should reduce stress, not create it.  
I design systems to be observable, reversible, and respectful of attention.
