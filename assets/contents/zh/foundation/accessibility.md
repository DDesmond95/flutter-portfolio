# Accessibility Statement

I believe technology should adapt to people — not the other way around.

---

## 🧠 Principles

1. **Readable by Default** — clear typography and high contrast.
2. **Keyboard-Friendly** — all navigation and forms operable without a mouse.
3. **Screen-Reader Support** — semantic HTML tags in Flutter web export.
4. **Color-Blind Safety** — palette verified for WCAG AA contrast.
5. **Motion Control** — minimal animation, no flashing effects.

## 🧩 Testing

Accessibility verified using:

- Flutter’s semantics debugger
- Axe DevTools
- VoiceOver (macOS) + NVDA (Windows)
